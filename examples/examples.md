# `diamondfp` Example files

## Basic Example Script
**[basic_example.py](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/basic_example.py)**

This script provides an example of importing fingerprint functions and applying them to predict similarity scoring between two players.

## Fingerprint Tanimoto Analysis Notebook
**[fp_tanimoto_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/fp_tanimoto_analysis.ipynb)**

This analysis notebook demonstrates how to create a fingerprint for every player in a dataset and how to then calculate the tanimoto similarity between every player. 

## Visualizing Fingerprints
**[visualizing_fp.ipynb](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/visualizing_fp.ipynb)**

This notebook demonstrates how to apply techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to fingerprints to visualize player similarity.

## `pybaseball` Example
**[pybaseball_example.ipynb](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/pybaseball_example.ipynb)**

This notebook gives an example of how to use the `pybaseball` library to directly import data from various sources and create fingerprints.
