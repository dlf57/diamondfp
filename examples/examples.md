# `diamondfp` Example files

## Basic Examples
### Binary Fingerprint Example Script
**[binaryfp_example.py](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/basics/binaryfp_example.py)**

This script provides an example of importing binary fingerprint functions and applying them to predict similarity scoring between two players.

### Normalized Fingerprint Example Script
**[normalizedfp_example.py](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/basics/normalizedfp_example.py)**

This script provides an example of importing normalized fingerprint functions and applying them to predict similarity scoring between two players.

### Fingerprint Tanimoto Analysis Notebook
**[fp_tanimoto_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/basics/fp_tanimoto_analysis.ipynb)**

This analysis notebook demonstrates how to create a fingerprint for every player in a dataset and how to then calculate the tanimoto similarity between every player. 

### `pybaseball` Example
**[pybaseball_example.ipynb](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/basics/pybaseball_example.ipynb)**

This notebook gives an example of how to use the `pybaseball` library to directly import data from various sources and create fingerprints. 

## Modeling Examples
### MVP Fingerprint Search
**[mvp_fp_search.ipynb](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/modeling/mvp_fp_search.ipynb)**

This notebook demonstrates how to create a fingerprint for previous MVP winners and then search for the most similar players this season.

### Cy Young Fingerprint Search
**[cy_young_fp_search.ipynb](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/modeling/cy_young_fp_search.ipynb)**

This notebook demonstrates how to create a fingerprint for previous Cy Young winners and then search for the most similar players this season.

### Matching Players with Molecules
**[molecule_match.ipynb](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/modeling/molecule_match.ipynb)**

This notebook demonstrates how to match baseball player fingerprints with molecular fingerprints.

## Visualization Examples
### Visualizing Fingerprints
**[visualizing_fp.ipynb](https://github.com/dlf57/diamondfp/blob/main/examples/visualizations/visualizing_fp.ipynb)**

This notebook demonstrates how to apply techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to fingerprints to visualize player similarity.
